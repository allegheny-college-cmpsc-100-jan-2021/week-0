    "`if` statements depart a bit from our traditional Python syntax. Whereas we've been focusing on assignment, and now relative equality, our work takes us into an area of programming which contemplates _how code actually_ runs. Why talk about this now instead of last week? Because we're going to mess with it a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow of control (or control flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we understand the following code snippet to run?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# We have five widgets\n",
    "widgets = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Professor gives us five more\n",
    "widgets += 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Due to a complex social situation, we owe 9/10 of our widgets to friends\n",
    "widget -= .90 * widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "# While once rich with widgets, we now have...\n",
    "print(widgets)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I can hear you through the internet: TOP TO BOTTOM! You're right. And code will _generally_ still follow this rule, which implies (for the above code):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variables must be created before we can use them\n",
    "* If the value of a variable changes over time, the most recent assignments \"wins\"\n",
    "* Whatever the value of the variable is at the end of the code is the final value\n",
    "\n",
    "These will all still be true, but sometimes (depending on circumstances), we can jump ahead a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back to `if` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want make different decisions in our code based on whether or not a condition is `True`. In this case, we engage branching logic to assist us in our programmatic decision-making by using the `if` statement. This statemet takes the general form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if CONDITION:\n",
    "    # Functionality if true\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `CONDITION` substitutes for some `boolean` value or expression which _must be true_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that the line proceeding the `if` portion of the statement is **_indented 4 spaces_**. Indentation is an important part of the Python language: it identifies what _belongs to_ this branch of our \"branching logic\": the `# Functionality if true` portion should only work if the `CONDITION` true. If not, it skips it. So:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if widgets > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"We're better off than we were before!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as we know from our example, we're not better off -- we actually only have `1` widget left! We need to be able to accomodate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if widgets > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"We're better off than we were before!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Somewhere we lost some widgets...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use an `else` clause to indicate what to do if the `CONDITION` (in this case, `widgets > 5`) isn't true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say, for sake of example, if we're completely out of widgets we want to do something else. We have the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `widgets > 5`, we're rich\n",
    "* If `widgets < 5` but still `widgets > 0`, at least we have a widget left\n",
    "* If `widgets == 0`, we're probably sad\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we model that in code?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if widgets > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"We're rich!\")\n",
    "elif widgets < 5 and widgets > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"At least we still have one.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Oh no! No widgets. But, look! The Professor gave us one!\")\n",
    "    widgets +=1\n",
    "print(widgets)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, okay, so I was nice. But, there are two things to notice about the above code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There's this new thing called the `elif` or \"else if\"\n",
    "* We can use as many statements as we want in a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are important. First, we can always add as many conditions as we want at any point. We already know about `relational` and `logical` combinations (`widgets < 5 and widgets > 0`), but the `elif` or \"else if\" allows us to do something else _in very specific cases_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we can write as many statements or expressions as we want in an `if` clause, as we see in the `else` branch of the statement above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we could go overboard:"
