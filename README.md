## A few reminders

This repository represents an entire week of content -- and you'll receive a repository like this at the beginning of week. A couple of things that this means:

1. You are free to work ahead of our course's pace if you want to engage, knowing that we'll cover each day sequentially.
2. Each day is "gradeable" by itself; simply `cd` to the `day-{N}` and run GatorGrader to get your progress on a given day's content.

You're also free to wait for us to address each day's topics in class. Regardless, all work for a given week is due _the Sunda after it is assigned_. Due dates are at the top of the `README.md` file in the lowest-level folder (this file).

## Student support

At any time -- during class, after class -- filing a "support ticket" guarantees that either I or a TL will be in contact about your issue. However, _it is your responsibility_ to schedule office hours with either myself or a TL to discuss your ticket in the most detail.

You can file support tickets here:
