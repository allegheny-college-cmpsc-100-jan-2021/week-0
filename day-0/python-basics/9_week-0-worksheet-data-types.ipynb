    "\n",
    "A brief detour for a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing calculations, you may have noticed that numbers you expected to come out as _whole_ numebers (aka `integers`) came out looking more like decimals (something called a `floating point number` or a `float`). Your curiosity is about to be rewarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are more data types that we will cover this semester, the basic three (3) that we'll see time and again are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* integers (whole numbers)\n",
    "* floating point numbers (decimal numbers)\n",
    "* strings\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen the first two (`integers` and `floating point numbers`) and we'll look at the last, `strings`, in this worksheet, too. Handily enough, we'll also briefly touch on _data conversion_, that is transforming one data type to another -- which is also a preview of `functions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers (`int`)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are whole numbers. They range from very large _negative numbers_ (-2147483647) to very large _positive numbers_ (+2147483647). Notice that _there is no decimal point_ here. Again -- whole numbers have no \"fractional part\" -- the decimal in a `floating point` number.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, in Python, integers can behave quite curiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by giving ourselves some integers to work with. \n",

    "\n",
    "Wait, both of the number used in the calculation above were `integers`! What happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing integers always _promotes_ them to `floats` in Python. The same goes for multiplying an `integer` with a `float`: it automatically \"promotes\" (becomes more _precise_).\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to `integers`, floating point numbers (`floats`) contain decimal places -- and only enough to fully express a number. That is, up to `16` digits past the decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's see that in action.\n",

    "Again, this could be expressed by `4050`, but because of _promotion_, the number becomes a `float`, rather than an `integer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Strings`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Strings` are groups of characters. Simple, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, maybe not. First things first, what's a \"character?\" Here's a hint: there's a difference between `4` and `\"4\"`. One is a number (`4`) and the other is a symbol which, to a machine, _represents a human-readable symbol_ for a number, but _is not_ a number. There's a ton of them that your computer recognizes, and they live in a thing called the [ASCII table](http://www.asciitable.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, characters are really just symbolic. They may look like letters (`a`,`b`,`c`,`...`) or numbers, but in the end they are just text. We can't do numerical operations on them. But, as we'll see later, we can do some kinds of operations on/with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Strings` are defined by placing `\"\"` (quotation marks) around the text which constitutes the string. Defining `strings` this way is _literally_ defining them. As such, they're called `string` `literals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Let's use them for some service for our widget factory and name it, assigning the `string` `\"Widget Factory 1.0\"` to the variable `factory_name`. \n",

    "\n",
    "### A detour into functions\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this worksheet, we're going to finish by addressing the last kind of statement we'll cover: functions. These operate a bit differently than everything we've seen so far, and merit a bit more discussion. In the following example, we'll use a function called `str` to convert our `monthly` widget production count into a `string`.\n",
