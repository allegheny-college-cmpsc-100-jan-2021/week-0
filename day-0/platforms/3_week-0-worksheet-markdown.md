## Markdown tidbits

Before we get started here, I invite you to meet Professor Bonham-Carter, who provides an overview of Markdown in the video below:

## Double, double toil and trouble

---

There's no long or short of it: I'm hungry and I'm not feeling particularly creative. I need you to help me with both parts of that: I want a recipe for something tasty to make.

That's your job. Mine was to tell you that I am hungry.

So what does that mean for you?

In [3a_week-0-worksheet-markdown.md](3a_week-0-worksheet-markdown.md), I'd like you to type a recipe which:

1. Uses _only one_ (1) level-one heading (`#`)
2. Uses _at least two_ (2) level-two headings (`##`)
3. Uses _at least two_ (2) lists (`*`)
4. Contains _at least one_ (1) paragraph describing the recipe (make it appealing, somehow)
5. Contains at least one image
  * Protip: you can copy/paste images _directly into_ the Markdown file

For an additional level of practice, double-click this text to see what my Markdown looks like!
  
## Finishing this activity

---

We'll verify that this activity is complete during [5_week-0-worksheet-github-push](5_week-0-worksheet-github-push.ipynb) activity. I'll test the relative quality and appeal of the outcome of the recipe later. That's, as we might say, subject to _taste_.

(If you can't tell already, I have the jokes.)
