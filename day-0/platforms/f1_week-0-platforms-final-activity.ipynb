    "> In 2021 a professor attempted to boggle their students' minds by sending them a game in which they hid a Golden Python whose scales were conjured from digital text. An enterprising computer system seized this priceless token and the fate of the Maltese Python remains a mystery to this day...\n",
    " \n",
    "For no reason whatsoever, you find yourself at the door to the very mansion where rumors place the whereabouts of the Maltese Python. (Is there really any benefit to asking why you find yourself here?)\n",
    " \n",
    "Of course, however, this is a digital mansion made of folders located in the `/mansion` file system and, as you would expect, this activity is meant to help you practice commands like: \n",
    " \n",
    "* `cd`\n",
    "* `ls`\n",
    "* `pwd`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use these commands to go from room to room in the mansion, keeping an eye out for secret passages (**HINT**: typing `secretpassages` at any time _may_ help you).When you think you 've found the python itself (you'll know when you do), type `claim` to steal it away (to your home directory; think `~`).\n",
    " \n",
    "Keep the mansion map handy so that as you `cd` and `pwd` through the directory structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special note\n",
    "\n",
    "`secretpassage` and `claim` _are not_ traditional terminal commands. They're made up for this exercise. Not real, but no less fun.\n",
