    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "This worksheet will invite you to tinker with the examples, as they are live code cells. Instead of the normal fill-in-the-blank style of notebook, feel free to mess with the code directly. Remember that -- to test things out -- the <a href = \"../sandbox/CMPSC%20100%20-%20Week%2000%20-%20Sandbox.ipynb\"><b>Sandbox</b></a> is available to you as well.\n",

    "We've mostly covered cases in which events or calculations need to happen one at a time or just one time in total. Occasionally -- much more than occasionally, really -- programs need to repeat instructions more than once until some given condition is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you read the word \"condition\" above and have started thinking `booleans` are involved: you're right yet again.\n",
    "\n",
    "While casually referred to as a \"loop\" structure, the technical term for this repetition is _iteration_ -- the process of repeating a set of statements until a given condition is no longer `True`. In the case of `while` loops, we can rephrase the statement above to read \"while the condition is true, repeat some statements\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`while` loops recall syntax similar to `if` statements:\n",

    "    # statements\n",

    "In the above block of code, we start by telling the program where to, well, start. Then we print that number followed by an instruction `seconds -= 1` to _decrement_ (decrease) that number by one _each time the loop runs_ (on each _iteration_). By the time we reach the end, the last run notices that `seconds == 0`, therefore `seconds` _is not_ greater than `0` anymore and it breaks out of the loop, executing the next statement after the loop.\n",

    "## Detour into user input\n",
    "\n",
    "Why user input and why now? As we'll see in future weeks, other kinds of loops can fulfill the same purpose as `while` loops. However, there's something unique that `while` loops can do that others aren't so well-suited to: handing user input. \n",
    "\n",
    "This relies on our understanding of _functions_ as we're about to learn a new one: `input()` -- a function which allows us to prompt users to enter data so that our programs can do an operation called \"parsing\" (understanding/reading) it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always helpful to put some `string` value in the parenthesis as the _argument_, to give a user some sense of what they're being requested to type. In fact, the general format of the function is, like others we've seen:\n",

    "# Where ARGUMENT will evaluate to a string\n",
