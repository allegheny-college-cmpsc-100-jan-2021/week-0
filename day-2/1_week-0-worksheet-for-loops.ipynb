    "The Python `for` loop extends what we know about the topic of _iteration_ -- see (`while` loops). And, I hear you asking: why do we need more than one type of loop? Hopefully this worksheet will help highlight the difference between these two _control structures_ (think _flow of control_), and give you a sense of at least intermediate mastery of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main, informal difference between the `while` and the `for` loop boils down to _counting_:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `for` loops\n",
    "\n",
    "* `for` loops are for situations where you can _count_ the number of _iterations_\n",
    "* `for` loops evaluate boolean conditions _implicitly_\n",
    "\n",
    "### `while` loops\n",
    "\n",
    "* `while` loops exist for cases where you can't count or predict the number of _iterations_\n",
    "* `while` loops evaluate boolean conditions _explicitly_\n",
    "\n",
    "## A comparison of `for` and `while`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the `while` loop reasonably well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while CONDITION:\n",
    "    # do instructions\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop looks a bit different and has two different expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using range\n",
    "for i in range(START #, END #, SKIP #):\n",
    "    # do instructions\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of range like _slicing syntax_ -- the parameters are somewhat the same and it provides similar functionality: from some `starting point`, go until some `ending point`, potentially skipping every `n` items. The last part -- the skip -- is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other expression makes it ideal for structures of unknown size:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for ELEMENT in DATA STRUCTURE:\n",
    "    # do something with ELEMENT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, the `for` loop creates an identifier which exists after the loop containing only the _last item loaded into it_ such as this example:"
